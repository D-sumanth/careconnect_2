# CareConnect

## Overview

CareConnect is a **centralized digital communication system** designed for care homes. It streamlines communication, ensures staff receive real-time updates, and enables acknowledgment tracking for accountability.

## Features

1. **Display Current Date and Time**:
    - The platform displays the current date and time on the main page and updates it every second.
2. **Update In-House and New Admissions Counts**:
    - Users can update the "In House" and "New Admissions" counts through a popup form. The updated counts are saved to the database and displayed on the main page.
3. **Add New Staff Members**:
    - Users can add new staff members by filling out a form in a popup. The new staff member's information is saved to the database.
4. **Categorized Information Cards**:
    - The main page displays three categories of information cards: Critical, Routine, and Event-Based. Clicking on a card redirects the user to a form page to submit new information for that category.
5. **Submit Information Forms**:
    - Users can submit information forms for different categories (Critical, Routine, Event-Based). The form includes fields for home, department, name, designation, information details, authorized by, state, and send to options. The submitted information is saved to the database.
6. **View Dashboard**:
    - Users can navigate to a dashboard page that displays categorized information (Critical, Routine, Event-Based) dynamically loaded from the database. The dashboard also shows the current date, time, in-house count, and new admissions count.
7. **Staff Dashboard**:
    - Users can navigate to a staff dashboard page that displays categorized information (Critical, Routine, Event-Based) dynamically loaded from the database. The staff dashboard also shows the current date, time, in-house count, and new admissions count.
8. **Acknowledge Information**:
    - Staff members can acknowledge information by selecting their name from a dropdown and clicking the acknowledge button. The acknowledgment is saved to the database, and the acknowledgment status is updated.
9. **View More Information**:
    - Users can view more details about a piece of information by clicking the "View More" button on the information card. This opens a modal with detailed information and acknowledgment status.
10. **Fetch and Display Counts**:
    - The platform fetches and displays the latest in-house and new admissions counts from the database when the page loads.
11. **Shared JavaScript Functions**:
    - The platform includes shared JavaScript functions for fetching and displaying counts, initializing the page, and handling form submissions.
12. **Responsive Design**:
    - The platform's design is responsive, ensuring proper rendering and usability on different devices and screen sizes.
*Note: More features and updates will be added as development progresses.*
